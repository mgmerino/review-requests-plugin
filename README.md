# Review requests counter for bitbar

This is a simple [bitbar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar) plugin, inspired by [this one](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar-plugins/blob/master/Dev/GitHub/github-review-requests.5m.py) which is written in python.

This has been rewritten in Ruby and enhanced with some more superfluous data about the PR's and loaded of emojis for no particular reason ðŸ¤–.

It uses Faraday as a http client to send a graphql query into github endpoint to retrieve the collection of PR reviews assigned to you.

## Dependencies
This plugin needs the following gems installed under your default system path/owner when running ruby scripts.

- faraday
